## What is eTrainose?
eTrainose is an **electronic nose (e-nose)** system based on gas sensors, designed to detect and classify odors.  
It combines sensor arrays, data acquisition, and **artificial intelligence (AI)** to identify different aroma patterns.  

This system can be applied in **food, environmental monitoring, and industrial** fields, making it a useful tool for both research and practical applications.

## What is it Used For?
- Collecting real-time data from gas sensors  
- Building aroma datasets through multiple acquisition cycles  
- Performing preprocessing and signal analysis  
- Training and running AI models to classify odors

## How to Start eTrainose
Follow these steps to run the eTrainose system:

1. Open the **ADB-Project** folder  
2. Navigate to the **development** folder  
3. Right-click inside the folder and select **Open in Terminal**  
4. Activate the conda environment with:  
   conda activate pyqtpr
5. Once the environment is active, run the main program with:
   python main.py
6. From here you can:
   - Start collecting data
   - Use the integrated AI to classify odors

## Notes
- Ensure the conda environment is properly installed
- Collected data can directly be used for AI classification
- For reliable results, gather enough acquisition cycles to build a strong dataset
